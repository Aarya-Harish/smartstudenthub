# 🔧 Frontend Registration Fix Guide

## 🎯 Problem Identified
The backend registration API is working perfectly, but the frontend signup page is not working properly.

## ✅ What I've Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

- Improved error messages to distinguish between network, server, and other errors
- Added debug information display

### 2. Created Debug Version

- Shows detailed API information and error details
- Helps identify the exact issue

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Better error messages
- Console logging for debugging
- Link to debug version for troubleshooting

## 🚀 How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Access the Debug Version
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/register-debug
2. Fill out the registration form

### Step 2: Test Regular Registration
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/register

### Step 3: Check Console Logs
Open browser developer tools (F12) and look for:
